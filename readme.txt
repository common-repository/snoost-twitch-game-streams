List the most popular live streams of a particular eSport game or search on Twitch.tv, with current viewer count and live previews.

== Description ==

Blogging about eSports or video games? Then this is the perfect plugin for your blog, as it lets you install a simple widget in the sidebar or footer, listing the most popular live streams of a particular game or Twitch search. It even shows real-time previews and the current viewer count for each stream, so your visitors can easily navigate to any Twitch stream of their desire.

= Support for any game =

It does not matter whether you want to list streams of League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Starcraft 2: Legacy of the Void or other games, the Snoost: Twitch Game Streams plugin support any game present on twitch. Simply place the widget in a sidebar where you want it to appear, and type in the name of the game you want to list streams of (Example: If you type “Star Citizen”, it will show live streams on Twitch of Star Citizen). All streams are sorted by the highest amount of current viewers, and updated every fifth minute.

= About Cloud Gaming =

The Twitch plugin is developed by [Snoost Cloud Gaming](https://www.snoost.com/), a game streaming service which aims to make casual and competitive gaming much more available to users without having to worry about the hardware requirements of modern PC games. Cloud gaming even takes Windows-only games to Linux, Mac and Chromebooks, and all you need is a solid internet connection for it to work properly.
